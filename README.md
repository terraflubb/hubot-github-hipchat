# hubot-github-hipchat

A Hubot Script for getting GitHub notifications in HipChat

See [`src/github-hipchat-notifier.coffee`](src/github-hipchat-notifier.coffee) for full documentation.

This was created because the out-of-the-box GitHub integration for Hipchat
was pants. This one will make annoucements in a channel without truncating
and more customization options.

There are many ways this could be improved.
